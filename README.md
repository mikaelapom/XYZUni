# XYZUni
We are using the Medium Phone virtual machine for this project. 

What we improved:

- Updated the design to be more consistent with Smith's color scheme. We used blue and gold school colors and Smith's font. We also added a title tab.
- Searching was originally limited to exact matches in the course name, we updated it to be "like" the text in the Course Name box so the user would only need to type part of the name.
- We adjusted the search function so that if the course name was left empty, it would search by the other filled in fields.
- Each time a course is added or deleted the GPA automatically updates.
- We fixed the GPA function to calculate correctly based on credit hours and course grade.
